# Gray's Guide to Surviving Space Engineering
## (Because Wikipedia Isnâ€™t Enough)

This repository is a collection of all the things that I've learned throughout my degree that I've used in space engineering that I've had the time to write down.

Very often lecturers assume you know more than you do. The Space Engineering Companion is my guide to all those things that I was expected to know or learn, so I hope at the very least it serves as a starting point for you in your studies.

As time goes on I intend to add more to this repository, but for now I hope what is here is able to help you as much as it would have helped me.
